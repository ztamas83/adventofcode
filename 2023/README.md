# My notes for 2023

## Day 1
Kinda straightforward, I did not find the "replace" solution but found the overlapping issue and ended up using a 3rd party regex library: https://pypi.org/project/regex/

## Day 2
Still a warmup excercise, nothing strange, some regex magic and string juggling.

## Day 3
Someone threw a stone through the window already on day 3.
Struggled a lot to find the right symbols and numbers. Regex helps a lot with re.finditer() but ended up with an awful lot of loops, not optimal, but works.

## Day 4
This went fast, sets and intersections make things happen
